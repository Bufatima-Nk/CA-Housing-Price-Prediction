# Regression Analysis - Predicting California Housing Prices

## Overview
Welcome to the California Housing Prices Predictive Analysis project! This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using regression analysis techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Goals
- Perform linear regression analysis to predict housing prices.
- Utilize feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.
- Visualize insights and patterns from the data.

## Data Source
The California Housing Prices dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be found on Kaggle.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:
- Data Loading and Initial Exploration.
- Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values.
- Descriptive Statistics and Summary Metrics.
- Data Visualization to Understand Patterns.

## Project Files
The main files in this project are:
- Regression Analysis - Predicting California Housing Prices.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with analysis code.
- housing.csv.zip: California Housing Prices dataset.
